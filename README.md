# Projecttips Summary
## This is my assignment for Fundamentals of Data Analytics. Higher Dip in Data Analytics GMIT
## By Celeste Quinlan.  Deadline 29th November 2019

## Description :
_The project includes a review of the Dataset "Tips" found in the Python
seaborn package, and graphs from variables I found that were relevantas well as an analysis between the variables .

## Tips dataset :
The Tips dataset is based around a particular food server and the tips the server received over 2 and a half months.The data details collected are broken into:

* Total bill, including tax, in dollars
* TIP Tip in dollars
* SEX Sex of person paying bill (0=male, 1=female)
* SMOKER Smoker in party? (0=No, 1=Yes)
* DAY 3=Thur, 4=Fri, 5=Sat, 6=Sun
* TIME 0=day, 1=night
* SIZE Size of the party

The data collection was assigned to the days and times, tables and clients  that the particular server was assigned to work.The dataset is included in seaborn as a dataframe,and  it hs 244 rows and 7 variables. By analysing the dataset we get an insight into the factors that may influence the tip quantity.

## Plan Outline :
* To syn my file with gitHub
* Set up my Jupyter file
* Include the seaborn data package tips
* Find max mins averages and any expected or unusual correlations( or misleading links )
* Especially total bill and tip amount
* Display graphs and plots


## Review my findings (Regression and Analysis):
Review other approaches and analysis and compare **total bill and tip amount** (and others) using descriptive statistics and plots.

## Conclusion :
Recap on findings and limitation of the variables suggestion of other variables that may give a more reliable picture. Discuss also relevance of certain variables
